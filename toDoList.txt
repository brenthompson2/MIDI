measure.cpp:
	- deconstructor?

measureList:
	- deconstructor?

FileReader:
	- fix processNote noteOff time
		- relative to noteDuration, currentMeasure, currentBeat
	- when read in new track, how create new measureList?
		- maybe in Write track, when reach new track event, turn off all notes, write end track, write new track head, then continue processingEvents
	
WriteTrack:
	- in main.h, make SIXTEENTH_DELTA == 1/4th of a beat
		- relative to main.cpp -> writeHeadChunk -> division and also writeTrack.cpp -> tempo
